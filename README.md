# NLP Lab Assignment 4

This repository contains the fourth lab assignment for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course. The assignment is implemented using a Jupyter Notebook and demonstrates core NLP techniques using Python and relevant libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn.

## 📚 Description

The notebook includes practical exercises and implementations that focus on various NLP concepts, which may include:

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Vectorization techniques (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Text classification or sentiment analysis
- Evaluation metrics for NLP tasks

> 📌 *Note: Specific modules and tasks may vary based on lab requirements.*
